<h1>Build & Deploy Notes</h1>

<p>This site is a collection of notes I've take about various technologies. Most notes are about installing and using tools on OS X, but some are Linux specific (Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat). For information on how this site is generated please see the <a href="/about">about</a> note.</p>
